## Java Assignment (Emergency Call Handler)

## What is it?

The local Emergency call handling for the police receives thousands of calls every day. Every call is logged, together with the response. Create a Java program to process these calls directing them to the appropriate response unit. You can assume that while the call is ongoing it remains in memory, to monitor the progress so, you should allow for 20 calls in memory at any one time. The response units available are as follows:

1. ARU â€“ Armed Response Unit
2. RTC (Road Traffic Collision) Investigation Unit
    1. Traffic Response
    a. Speeding
    b. Drunk / drug driving
    c. Road Closures
    d. RTC
3. CID (Criminal Investigation Department) for:
a. Theft
b. Personal Injury (Assault)
c. MIT Murder Investigation Team

Your program should create a facility to store call details:

1. Date and time of call
2. Nature of call:
a. RTC
b. Assault
c. Murder
d. Brandishing a weapon
e. Theft/Burglary/Criminal damage
3. Response unit assigned
4. Location of Incident
5. Description of incident (max 256ch)

At the end of the shift all call incidents are stored on a csv file, which when officers investigating an incident would like to view, they can be quickly retrieved and displayed.
